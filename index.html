    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I live in Pulaski, PA on a old farm. We are not farmers, we just love the porperty and the outdoors. Growing up
        I had a lot of fun spending time outside enjoying nature. We usually spend our time walking through the woods
        in our backyard, finding interesting niches in the wildlife. We also spent a lot of our time ride motorcycles.
        I recently joined the Trilogy bootcamp to learn about programming and web developement. I aspire to gain as
        much knowledge as posible from this course so I can get an exciting job and to got back to college to get a
        degree in software engineering. I play videogames regularly in my free time and would like to become a game
        developer one day.</p>
